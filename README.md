#Dynamic Maze Solver

#Project Overview

#The Dynamic Maze Solver is an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate and explore maze-solving algorithms. This project leverages the power of React, using advanced React Hooks to manage state and animations dynamically. Users can generate mazes and visually track the execution of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms as they navigate through the maze.

Features
Dynamic Maze Generation: Allows users to create new mazes on demand.
Algorithm Visualization: Offers a real-time visualization of BFS and DFS algorithms.
Interactive User Interface: Users can interact with the maze, choose the algorithm, and start or reset the maze solving process.
Sound Effects: Provides auditory feedback during the pathfinding process, enhancing the interactive experience.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used
React.js: Utilizes React Hooks for state management and component lifecycle management.
Vite: Employs Vite as the build tool for faster development and build optimization.
CSS3: Advanced CSS for animations and styling to create a visually appealing interface.
